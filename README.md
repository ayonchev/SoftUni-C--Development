# Software University Solutions
In this repository I have put all of the solutions to the labs, homeworks and exams for the courses that I have studied at the **Software University**.

## Structure
* At the root are the *Open Courses* which I have studied alongside with the *CSharp-Development* folder in which I've put all of the courses that I have studied that are part of the **C# Development Program**
* In the *CSharp-Development* folder I've put all of the courses that are part of the **C# Development Program**
* In each course there might be a couple of folders - *Exams*, *Exercises-and-Labs*. I've placed all of my solutions there. I have also added all of the documents containing the details of the problems alongside other important resources in the *Resources* folders.

## Certificates
Here is a list of the certificates that I've acquired. Some of the courses I've studied on my own with the materials provided by **Software University** and that's why I don't have certificates for completing them.
